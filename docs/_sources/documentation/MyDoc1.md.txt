# Basic Functions
The app is made of two main pages, the Jupyter Lab and the Jupyter Manager.
Jupyter Lab is where you can play with your python code, while Jupyter Manager is where you manage the Jupyter server and see your app's logs. 
You can access these pages from the ctrlX Dashboard sidebar as shown in the picture. If you can not see the Jupyter Manager tab, it means that you don't have the full access permission.

## Start and Stop your Python project
You can choose a python file to be executed when the app starts. To do so, place a python file named "app.py" inside a folder named "project", as shown in the following picture. 

You can also Start and Stop your file by using the relevant buttons in the Manage App section of the Jupyter Manager. If you would like to see the logs that your app generates, start the app using the yellow "Start with debug" button.
